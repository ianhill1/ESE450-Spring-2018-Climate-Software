## SIMPLEST WAY TO RUN: use the user inputs section of the "callBoxModel.m" file to change you time range, feedback parameter range, ocean/atmosphere depth.

 There are MANY more paramteres in the OceanRise.m and BoxModel.m function files which may be changed as well. For 
 questions message me here, or email at hilli@oregonstate.edu
